# biopython-scripts
A collection of Biopython scripts for practicing sequence analysis, parsing biological file formats (FASTA, GenBank, etc.), and exploring genomic data. 

# GenBank File Parsing Script

This repository contains a Python script that parses GenBank files to extract key information, such as gene names, product descriptions, and CDS (coding sequences) from a GenBank file.

## Project Overview

The script reads a GenBank file, extracts relevant metadata, and displays it in a user-friendly format. It specifically identifies and extracts features of interest, such as:
- Gene ID
- Gene Description
- Length of the sequence
- CDS (Coding Sequence) location, strand, gene name, product, and translation

.

## Features
- Reads GenBank files and parses them efficiently using `BioPython`.
- Extracts gene-related information, including gene names, descriptions, and CDS features.
- Handles user input for specifying the GenBank file.
